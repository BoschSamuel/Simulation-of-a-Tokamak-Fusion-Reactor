# Simulation-of-a-Tokamak-Fusion-Reactor
I created a tokamak fusion reactor simulation in Matlab as part of a project at university. 
It demonstrates how charged high-energy particles can be held in a magnetic bottle (the Tokamak), 
without touching its walls and melting them due to extremely high temperatures. 
The magnetic field has a very complicated shape, as it is created by multiple current coils and 
a rotating charged plasma cloud.
